Stimulation of SYN Flood attacks and counter-attack methods using average connection times

<b>Abstract</b>: While SYN Flood attack leveraging TCP protocol is not new, this method is still by far the most popular attack type. In this paper, a stimulation of a TCP server is introduced, as well as three different ways to gather data on connection times and number of unresolved requests to connect in the server. The results show that the most efficient way to do so would be to use an average of only successful handshake connections to apply as a server timeout.
